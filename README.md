Smart contracts for C4Coin's on-chain methodologies

* `develop` — [add circleci badge]
* `master` — [add circleci badge]

## Overview

_insert overview_

## Development

The smart contracts are being implemented in Solidity `0.4.23`.

### Development Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](htps://nodejs.org), version 9.11.1 (I use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage Node versions — `brew install nvm`.)
* [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), which is a comprehensive framework for Ethereum development. `npm install -g truffle` — this should install Truffle v4.1.7 or better.  Check that with `truffle version`.
* [Access to the C4Coin Jira](https://c4coin.atlassian.net)

### Initialisation

    npm install

### Testing

#### Standalone

    npm test

or with code coverage

    npm run test:cov

#### From within Truffle

Run the `truffle` development environment

    truffle develop

then from the prompt you can run

    compile
    migrate
    test

as well as other Truffle commands. See [truffleframework.com](http://truffleframework.com) for more.

### Linting

We provide the following linting options

* `npm run lint:sol` — to lint the Solidity files, and
* `npm run lint:js` — to lint the Javascript.
